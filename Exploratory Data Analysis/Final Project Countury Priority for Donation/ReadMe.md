# S670 Course Final Project : Setting Priorities for Country Donation.


The objective of this project is to classify countries based on socio-economic and health factors that play a crucial
role in determining a country’s overall development. The problem at hand involves HELP International, which has
successfully raised $10 million. Now, the CEO is faced with the strategic and effective allocation of this fund. The
decision-making process involves identifying countries in dire need of aid. As a Data Scientist, my goal is to cluster
countries by analyzing socio-economic and health factors influencing their development. Subsequently, I recommend
the countries that demand the CEO’s utmost attention and focus for targeted assistance from KNN algorithm and
principal component analysis.
