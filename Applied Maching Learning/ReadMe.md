# P 556: APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING Course in Computer Science Department

### HW 02 - KNN: classification, regression + EDA + ML pipelines
Outcomes and Goals:
- Describe the K-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm for both regression and classification
- Articulate the algorithmic steps for training and testing for KNN (regression/classification)
- Understand image processing and classification tasks and apply KNN to these
- Master how hyperparameter selection can be accomplished via crossfold validation
- Describe implementations that make for efficient KNN learning and prediction
- Understand how to be Pythonic when coding up KNN (no FOR loops if possible)
- Implementing KNN and weighted KNN as classes
